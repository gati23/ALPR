# Automatic License Plate Recognition
## Project Objectives
* Developed a program to recognize automatic license plates based on limited dataset.
* Localized license plate by applying morphological operations and utilizing contour properties.
* Segmented character-like regions of the license plates by applying perspective transforms, performing a connected component analysis, and utilizing contour properties.
* Scissored the true characters from previous step by pruning extraneous license plate character candidates, and extracting each character from binary image to create a training set for building classifiers.

## Approaches
* The dataset is obtained from [Medialab group](http://www.medialab.ntua.gr/research/LPRdatabase.html), National Technical University of Athens in Greece.
* Assumptions made in this project:
  * The license plate text is always darker than the license plate background
  * The license plate itself is in a rectangular shape
  * Width of the license plate is longer than length of it.

## Results
### License Plate Localization
Figure 1 & Figure 2 demonstrate the two sample process of localizing the license plate.

Figure 2: Process of localizing the license plate for sample # 2.

In the process, the top left image is blackhat operation to reveal the dark text of license plate characters against the light background. the top middle image is thresholding to reveal light region. The top right image computes the gradient along the x-axis of blackhat image. Comparing to to the top left image, the top right image has highlighted regions that contain strong vertical edge, e.g. characters on license plate.

The bottom left image applys rectangular closing operation to close gaps between the license plate characters. Then Otsu automatic thresholding is used on the closed image to obtain binary representation.The bottom middle image uses a series of erosions and dilations to clean up the binary image and remove the regions that do not interest us. Bottom right image has been further cleaned up by applying a bitwise and on the threshold image, keeping on the light regions of the image.

Finally, the bottom far right image shows the results after series operations.  

Though there are some false positive cases, such as Figure 3 shown below, this problem will be solved when segmenting characters from the license plate.

### Characters Segmentation
Figure 4 & Figure 5 illustrate the process of segmenting the characters on license plate.

Since the original license plate the dataset could be distorted or skewed, which could hurt the performance of character classification later in the pipeline, a perspective transform is applied to obtain a top-down, 90-degree viewing angle of the license plate, as top part of right image shown.

By applying adaptive thresholding to the license plate image, the gap between characters and other things (e.g. bolt, license plate frame, special symbols) can be clearly visible, as middle part of right image shown.

By applying connected component analysis and computing convex hull to the thresholded image, character-like regions can be found, as bottom part of right image shown.

### Character Scissoring
Figure 6 & Figure 7 show the processing of scissoring the character on the license plate.

Figure 7: Process of scissoring the character on licensen plate for sample # 2.

The top 2 images in the middle part of both figures are from previous step. After applying a character-like region pruning method, true character regions are found, as shown in bottom two images in the middle part.

After applying a scissoring method, each character can be segmented, which will be useful for building the SVM model later.

### Character classification
Extracted character examples can be found [here](https://github.com/meng1994412/ALPR/tree/master/automatic_license_number_recognition/output/examples). Letter and number classifier can be found [here](https://github.com/meng1994412/ALPR/tree/master/automatic_license_number_recognition/output), which is named [char.cpickle](https://github.com/meng1994412/ALPR/blob/master/automatic_license_number_recognition/output/char.cpickle) and [digit.cpickle](https://github.com/meng1994412/ALPR/blob/master/automatic_license_number_recognition/output/digit.cpickle).

Figure 8 & Figure 9 shows the final results of two samples recognizing the license plate.
